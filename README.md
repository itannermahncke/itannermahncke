# Hi there 👋 I'm Ivy!

I'm an aspiring robotics engineer at Olin College of Engineering. I'm interested in all things robotic software: particularly path planning, perception, and state estimation! I primarily develop in Python, C, and Java, with a special focus on developing ROS and ROS2 packages.

## I'm very passionate about expeditionary autonomy! I want to work on robots that...

- Explore harsh and unstructured environments (like ocean systems, or alien worlds!)
- Gather data and make decisions alongside engineers and scientists
- Are capable of working on multi-robot or human-in-the-loop teams

## I've deployed software on all kinds of robots, including...

- Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) ([Portfolio Page](https://imahncke.myportfolio.com/mit-lincoln-laboratory-advanced-undersea-systems))
- Modified vaccuum robots ([Project Website](https://itannermahncke.github.io/fleet_robotics/))
- Balancing robots ([Portfolio Page](https://imahncke.myportfolio.com/system-dynamics-rocky-project))
- And more!!!

## Please check out my best work at [my portfolio](https://imahncke.myportfolio.com/)! To start, here's a quick primer:

- Extended Kalman Filtering to localize a mobile robot in a homemade simulator ([GitHub Page](https://github.com/itannermahncke/extended-kalman-filtering)) ([Portfolio Page](https://imahncke.myportfolio.com/extended-kalman-filtering-for-robot-localization))
- Training an mobile robot to navigate a warehouse using Q-learning ([GitHub Page](github.com/itannermahncke/stochastic_q-learning_navigation/)) ([Portfolio Page](https://imahncke.myportfolio.com/q-learning-for-warehouse-navigation))
- Multi-agent path planning for a decentralized robotic fleet ([GitHub Page](https://github.com/itannermahncke/fleet_robotics)) ([Project Website](https://itannermahncke.github.io/fleet_robotics/))
- Autonomous waiter robot codebase (full navigation stack, perception, control) ([GitHub Page](https://github.com/itannermahncke/pie_waiterbot)) ([Project Website](https://olincollege.github.io/pie-2024-03/waiterbot/))
