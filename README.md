## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Ivy!

I'm an aspiring robotics engineer at Olin College of Engineering. I'm interested in all things robotic software: particularly path planning, perception, and state estimation. I primarily develop in Python, C, and Java, with a special focus on developing ROS and ROS2 packages. On my GitHub, you'll find everything from polished projects to small experiments -- if you want to see the most professional display of my work, please check out [my portfolio](https://imahncke.myportfolio.com/).

### Right now, I'm involved in climate robotics research at Olin!

I'm working on an intelligent autonomy project focused on coverage path planning for ASVs studying coral reef systems. You can read my [system design document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EQueDtxi3Mqqq7yS0Ds5HbZkS5oiRqB0dqToZ39L-A4/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.9im9ss3zt7ig) and view the project's [Github Page](https://github.com/itannermahncke/fleet_robotics).

### Also, here are my best class projects:

- Decentralized multi-agent path planning and localization for a robotic fleet ([GitHub Page](https://github.com/itannermahncke/fleet_robotics)) ([Project Website](https://itannermahncke.github.io/fleet_robotics/))
- Autonomous waiter robot codebase (full nav stack, perception, control) ([GitHub Page](https://github.com/itannermahncke/pie_waiterbot)) ([Project Website](https://olincollege.github.io/pie-2024-03/waiterbot/))
- Playable open-world retro JRPG ([GitHub Page](https://github.com/olincollege/top-down-dungeon-crawler)) ([Project Website](https://olincollege.github.io/top-down-dungeon-crawler/))
