# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Ivy!

I'm an aspiring robotics engineer at Olin College of Engineering. I'm interested in all things robotic software: particularly path planning, perception, and state estimation! I primarily develop in Python, C, and Java, with a special focus on developing ROS and ROS2 packages.

## I'm very passionate about expeditionary autonomy! I want to work on robots that...

- Explore harsh and unstructured environments (like ocean systems, or alien worlds!)
- Gather data and make decisions alongside engineers and scientists
- Are capable of working on multi-robot or human-in-the-loop teams

## Please check out my best work at [my portfolio](https://imahncke.myportfolio.com/)! To start, here's a quick primer:

### Right now, I'm involved in climate robotics research at Olin!

I'm working on an intelligent autonomy project focused on coverage path planning for ASVs studying coral reef systems. I'm really proud of the work I've done so far, and I'm excited to share the finished product in May 2025!
You can read my [system design document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EQueDtxi3Mqqq7yS0Ds5HbZkS5oiRqB0dqToZ39L-A4) and view the project's [Github Page](https://github.com/itannermahncke/iterative_coverage_path_planner).

### Also, here are my best class projects:

- Multi-agent path planning for a decentralized robotic fleet ([GitHub Page](https://github.com/itannermahncke/fleet_robotics)) ([Project Website](https://itannermahncke.github.io/fleet_robotics/))
- Autonomous waiter robot codebase (full navigation stack, perception, control) ([GitHub Page](https://github.com/itannermahncke/pie_waiterbot)) ([Project Website](https://olincollege.github.io/pie-2024-03/waiterbot/))
- Dino Game-inspired sidescroller for the GameBoy Advance ([GitHub Page](https://github.com/olincollege/biplup-run))
- Playable open-world retro JRPG ([GitHub Page](https://github.com/olincollege/top-down-dungeon-crawler)) ([Project Website](https://olincollege.github.io/top-down-dungeon-crawler/))

### And here's some ongoing work:

- Solving concurrency puzzles from The Little Book of Semaphores ([Github Page](https://github.com/itannermahncke/semaphore_puzzles))
