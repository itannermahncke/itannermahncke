# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Ivy!

I'm an aspiring robotics engineer at Olin College of Engineering. I'm interested in all things robotic software: particularly path planning, perception, and state estimation! I primarily develop in Python, C, and Java, with a special focus on developing ROS and ROS2 packages.

## I'm very passionate about expeditionary systems! I want to work on robots that...

- Explore harsh and unstructured environments
- Gather data and make decisions on the behalf engineers and scientists
- Are capable of working on multi-robot or human-in-the-loop teams

## Please check out my best work at [my portfolio](https://imahncke.myportfolio.com/)! To start, here's a quick primer:

## Right now, I'm involved in climate robotics research at Olin!

I'm working on an intelligent autonomy project focused on coverage path planning for ASVs studying coral reef systems. I'm really proud of the work I've done so far, and I'm excited to share the finished product in May 2025!
